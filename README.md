# Tokenizer
42 Blockchain project 

## Implementation choices

### Why I chose Ethereum over other blockchain platforms

-   Ethereum is the **_most popular blockchain platform_** for creating smart contracts and decentralized applications.
-   Other blockchain platforms, such as Bitcoin and Binance Smart Chain, do not support smart contracts or have limited support for smart contracts.
-   Ethereum has a large and active developer community, making it easy to find resources and support for creating smart contracts and decentralized applications.

### Why I chose ERC20 over other token standards

-   ERC20 is a standard interface for fungible tokens, meaning that each token is identical to every other token. **_This is the most common type of token on the Ethereum network._**
-   Other token standards, such as ERC721 and ERC1155, are used for non-fungible tokens, which are unique and indivisible tokens.
-   ERC20 tokens are supported by most exchanges and wallets, making them **_easy to integrate._**
-   ERC20 tokens are **_easy to create and deploy_**, and they can be used for a wide range of applications, from simple token transfers to complex decentralized applications.
-   ERC20 tokens are **_interoperable_**, meaning that they can be used with other smart contracts and decentralized applications on the Ethereum network.
-   ERC20 tokens are **_secure and reliable_**, as they are based on the Ethereum network, which is one of the most secure and reliable blockchain networks in the world.
-   ERC20 tokens are **_transparent and auditable_**, as all transactions are recorded on the Ethereum blockchain and can be easily verified by anyone.

### Why I chose Solidity as the programming language

-   Solidity is a **_high-level programming language_** that is specifically designed for writing smart contracts on the Ethereum network.

### Why I chose to deploy with Remix IDE

-   Remix IDE is an **_online development environment_** that allows you to write, test, and deploy smart contracts on the Ethereum network.
-   Remix IDE is **_easy to use_**, with a simple and intuitive interface that makes it easy to write and deploy smart contracts.

### Why I chose to deploy on the Sepolia testnet

-   The Sepolia testnet is a **_public test network_** that is designed to test smart contracts and decentralized applications before deploying them on the Ethereum mainnet.
-   The Sepolia testnet is **_fast and reliable_**, with low transaction fees and high throughput, making it ideal for testing and deploying smart contracts.

### Why I chose to use the MetaMask wallet

-   MetaMask is a **_popular Ethereum wallet_** that allows you to store, send, and receive ERC20 tokens and other cryptocurrencies.
-   MetaMask is **_easy to use_**, with a simple and intuitive interface that makes it easy to manage your tokens and interact with decentralized applications.

### Why I chose to use the Etherscan blockchain explorer

-   Etherscan is a **_blockchain explorer_** that allows you to view and verify transactions on the Ethereum network.
-   Etherscan is **_easy to use_**, with a simple and intuitive interface that makes it easy to search for transactions and view detailed information about smart contracts and decentralized applications.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, I chose to create an **_ERC20_** token using the **_Remix IDE_**, deploy it on the **_Sepolia_** testnet, and interact with it using the **_MetaMask_** wallet and the **_Etherscan_** blockchain explorer because they are all easy to use, reliable, and secure tools that make it easy to create, deploy, and interact with smart contracts on the Ethereum network.
